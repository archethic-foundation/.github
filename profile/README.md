# Welcome to Archethic Github!

Archethic is a Layer 1 blockchain protocol. We have innovated multiple aspects of the blockchain design to achieve scale, security, sustainability, and simplicity without foregoing the core tenet of decentralization. 
All these innovations have been thoroughly researched and they are now being implemented right here!

Archethic offers the first integrated services platform capable of meeting a fundamental need: giving everyone back the control over technology. In this way, ArchEthic is part of the promise of a safer,
more inclusive, and truly decentralized world. 4 years of research endow Archethic with the technological attributes that its predecessors have lacked - scalability, speed, reliability and simplicity of native biometric recognition.

Designed for mass adoption, Archethic relies on a new form of unbreakable validation consensus (ARCH), which is ultra-secure and allows an unlimited number of transactions. 

Our cryptocurrency, the UCO, is the backbone of the network that fuels the transactions and monetizes the contributorsâ€™ investments, pays the miners, and develops the ecosystem built for the people by the people. Our blockchain platform aims to replace and to improve all current
applications with a comprehensive and open ecosystem, allowing people to move from the trust imposed by centralized systems to a decentralized system where everyone will retain control of their data, property, and privacy.
Archethic gives back to humanity control over technology, and to each individual, control over their identity.
